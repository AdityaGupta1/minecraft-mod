Bukkit
------
For Bukkit mods, go to https://github.com/arun-gupta/bukkit-workshop.

Forge
------
* For forge, copy the "forge" directory from this repository and paste it into your modkit (which you can get from http://www.devoxx4kids.org/usa/workshops/minecraft-modding/). It already has a forge derectory. When you copy the forge folder into you rmodkit, it will merge the two forge folders together.
* If your computer asks you if you want to replace a certain file with a new one, say yes.
* When you launch Minecraft from Eclipse, it should have new items in it that are related to sapphires(Sapphires, Sapphire Blocks, etc.).
