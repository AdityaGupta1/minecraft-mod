### To install these mods:

1. Obtain the modkit from [here](http://www.devoxx4kids.org/usa/workshops/minecraft-modding/). Overlay the "forge" directory from one of the folders with a mod name in it (sapphire-forge, industrial-forge, etc.) to the modkit. The modkit already has a forge directory. When you copy the forge folder into your modkit, it will merge the two forge folders together.

2. If your computer asks you if you want to replace CreativeTabs.java with a different CreativeTabs.java, say yes, because this will add the new creative tab for the sapphires.

3. When you launch Minecraft from the Eclipse in the modkit, it should have the items and blocks that are stated above in a new tab.
