##Sapphire Mod

The Sapphire Mod adds:

* Sapphires
* Sapphire Blocks
* Sapphire Ore that generates in the Overworld
* Sapphire Glass which is clear except for a border around the edges
* Sapphire Tools
    * Sapphire Sword (does 7 damage)
    * Sapphire Axe
    * Sapphire Pickaxe
    * Sapphire Hoe
    * Sapphire Shovel
* A new creative tab to contain all of these items
* Crafting and smelting recipes for these items

1.Obtain the modkit from http://www.devoxx4kids.org/usa/workshops/minecraft-modding/. Copy the "forge" directory from this repository to the modkit. The modkit already has a forge directory. When you copy the forge folder into your modkit, it will merge the two forge folders together.
2. If your computer asks you if you want to replace CreativeTabs.java with a different CreativeTabs.java, say yes.
3. When you launch Minecraft from the Eclipse in the modkit, it should have the items and blocks that are stated above.
